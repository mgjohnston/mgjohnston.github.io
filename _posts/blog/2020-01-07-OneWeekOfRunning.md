I can't run. I've never been a runner and thought I never would be - until this New Year's.

I set myself the challenge of running at least 5k everyday, at any pace: even walking.

As of today (including a testing the waters run on the 31st) I have run almost exactly a marathon (42.2 km, 4h17min).

| Day | Distance | 1k Time | 5k Time |
|-------|--------|---------|---------|
| 0 | 6.51 | 5:37 | 32:31 |
| 1 | 5.02 | 5:32 | 34:46 |
| 2 | 5.14 | 5:12 | 33:08 |
| 3 | 5.01 | 5:30 | 36:14 |
| 4 | 5.08 | 4:57 | 27:25 |
| 5 | 5.12 | 5:12 | 28:22 |
| 6 | 5.16 | 5:27 | 29:16 |
| 7 | 5.17 | 5:19 | 30:08 |
