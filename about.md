### Me
I’m a technology executive focussed on retail and the customer with a background in data science, analytics, and engineering. Currently, as CTO at Jollyes, I oversee the tech infrastructure for 100+ stores, from payment systems to data insights for the board and PE investors. Previously, I led marketing data science at Sainsbury’s, personalising offers 1-2-1 to the customer to drive millions in marketing value and optimizing digital ad spend.

I hold a PhD in Biology from the John Innes Centre, where I worked on big data analysis and statistical modeling ([open access papers here](../publications/)). I've recently finished volunteering at [United Kingdom Biology Competitions](https://ukbiologycompetitions.org/) after 10 years (5 of which as Chair). We provided biology exams for 70,000+ students and 1,000+ schols annually. I'm actively seeking new volunteering opportunities for the public benefit, so if you need education, technology, retail, biology, or data experience please reach out. 

Here's a copy of my [one-page CV](../JohnstonCV.pdf).

### Site

Here, is an archive of my [scientific publications](../publications/) with free-to-access PDFs of all the works I am assoicated with. As well as a collection of [posts](../) about hobbies, from statistical riddles to homebrew.
