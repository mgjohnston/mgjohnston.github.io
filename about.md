### Me

I have a data background working within a range of domains from genomic analysis and statistics to data management and interrogation within a Tier 1 bank.

I hold a PhD in biology, where I worked on plant defence and published academic papers on statistics (and biology!). More recently, I worked as a data consultant within financial services, working quickly to solve Client data problems. I also Chair a charity ([United Kingdom Biology Competitions](https://ukbiologycompetitions.org/uk-biology-competitions/)), where I manage the provision of exams for over 30,000 students and 500 schools annually by a committee of volunteers.

During my PhD, developed skills in big data analysis of next generation sequencing data, and advanced statistical methods with the analysis of both continuous and discrete data. This was done alongside the development of novel wet-bench protocols for the extraction and purification of plasmodesmata from mature tissue, which exemplify strong analytical and experimental abilities. 

Here's a copy of my [one-page CV](../JohnstonCV.pdf).

### Site

Here, is an archive of my [scientific publications](../publications/) with free-to-access PDFs of all the works I am assoicated with. As well as a collection of [posts](../) about hobbies, from statistical riddles to homebrew.
