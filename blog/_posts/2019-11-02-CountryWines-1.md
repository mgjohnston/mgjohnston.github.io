After a summer of a pear a day, there was still several kilos of pears left on my tree. What better to attempt than homemade perry?

(With apologies to CJJ Berry - First Steps in Winemaking)

### Perry (Lambrini?)

* 5 kilos of pears
* 1 kg sugar
* Yeast nutrient (boiled baker's yeast)
* Campden tablets
* Yeast EC-1118
* Pectin enzyme
* 3 gallons water

1. Blend the pears into a pulp
2. Mix with other ingredients and top up to 3 gallons
3. Ferment in bucket fermenter for 3 weeks with airlock
4. Strain into demijohns (add more sugar for a sweeter perry)
5. Drink a few weeks later

### Lemon Mead

* 3 jars honey (750g)
* 1 jar lemon curd (250g)
* Yeast nutrient (boiled baker's yeast)
* Campden tablets
* Yeast EC-1118
* 1 gallon water

1. Mix with other ingredients and top up to 1 gallon
   * We missed an important part of boiling everything together beforehand....
2. Ferment in demijohn for 2 monthswith airlock
