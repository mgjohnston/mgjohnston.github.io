Three weeks in, past the 100 km mark, and I've hurt my knee - not by running though but by walking down stairs.

I can fully recommend compression socks to stop shin splints, and soon I will find out how well knee braces work...

For now though, I have graphed my stats from Strava (pulled using this nifty website <https://www.benwebb.net/>).
