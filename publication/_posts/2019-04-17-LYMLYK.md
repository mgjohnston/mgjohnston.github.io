The plasma membrane (PM) that lines plasmodesmata has a distinct protein and lipid composition, underpinning specific regulation of these connections between cells. The plasmodesmal PM can integrate extracellular signals differently from the cellular PM, but it is not known how this specificity is established or how a single stimulus can trigger independent signalling cascades in neighbouring membrane domains. Here we have used the fungal elicitor chitin to investigate signal integration and responses at the plasmodesmal PM. We found that the plasmodesmal PM employs a receptor complex composed of the LysM receptors LYM2 and LYK4 which respectively change their location and interactions in response to chitin. Downstream, signalling is transmitted via a specific phosphorylation signature of an NADPH oxidase and localised callose synthesis that causes plasmodesmata closure. This demonstrates the plasmodesmal PM deploys both plasmodesmata-specific components and differential activation of PM-common components to independently integrate an immune signal.
